  <h1>Life</h1>
  <p>As I live each day</p>
  <p>Nothing about this life seems sensible</p>
  <p>Today we laugh and love</p>
  <p>Tomorrow we weep and hate</p>
  <p>We seek that which is out of our reach</p>
  <p>We acquire what we never thought of</p>
  <p>Life, a paradox or an oxymoron</p>
  <p>That I do not know.</p>
  <p>For what I do know is the beauty it sheds in its</p>
  <p>whimsical bliss.</p>
  <p>A life unknown is beautiful.</p>
  <p>A life known is history.</p>
  <p>Everything that happens in this universe is fair.</p>
  <p>We may not understand, but it is.</p>
  <p>You know you have lived when you are ready for death.</p>
  <p>So live a life that prepares you for death.</p>
  <p>- Ato Donkor.</p>
