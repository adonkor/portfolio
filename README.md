# portfolio
In this portfolio of mine, it it is categorized into 8 main pages and three other pages.
the first page is the table of content which gives you an overwivew of what my entire portfolio talks about.
The goal of this portfolio is to give you a general overview of who I am and what I enhoy doing and my goals and aspirations.
But most importantly, I have fallen in love with web development especially css so although my portfolio may not be too exciting,
it gave me the chance to practice my skills on some css and keep learning javascript and vuejs.
This portfolio is also to serve as a reference to my growth in the future.
