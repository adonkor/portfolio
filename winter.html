<h1>WINTER BREEZE</h1>
<p>Winter breeze blew by</p>
<p>And all I could say was goodbye</p>
<p>Things that greeted back were</p>
<p>A satire and a cold heart.</p>
<p>It’s half past 10 and I’m still waiting for you</p>
<p>to come by.</p>
<p>Strangers, friends and all creatures walked past me</p>
<p>Strangers, friends, was what we were then</p>
<p>Love-ers – dead, is what we are now</p>
<p>no one knows what we will become, after</p>
<p>And fear elusions my soul.</p>
<p>Winter’s breeze - tickled nostrils</p>
<p>And all I did was sneeze</p>
<p>It will be a blessing, if you do come back</p>
<p>- Ato Donkor.</p>
