        <h1> THIS IS MY ASPIRATIONS</h1>

        During my third year in college, I go the opportunity to intern at a fortune 500 insurance company in hartford connecticut thecalled Travelers.
          I worked there as an IT intern where I truly got exposed to the real world life and comporate lifestlye. I learned a lot on how to network, construct my resume
          And it just opened my eyes on the genesis on of a new phase of my life. The internship was a true wake up call for me. I learned a lot on the job and connected with
          lots of people at the company from all sorts of levels in the company and walks of life. After my internship ended that summer, I started really planning on my future
          I started applying to lots of full time position jobs and I was blessed to get to work for a great company located in Farmington, Allied World Insurance Company.
          It is the best place I have worked at thus far. Lovely work atmosphere and the best team mates I have ever worked with so far. I have great aspirations for the future.
        Some of those aspirations are starting a tech company in the future, because I feel like there's a lot of problems to be solved and services to be rendered to the world.
        I would love to go back to my home country someday and give back to the country in ways like charity work and community service and promote tech in the country to inspire
         and uplift the youth of the country as well as exposing them to different opportunities. The world needs lots of kindness and help in fighting for the survival of our planet
       and I am ready to to fight the fight and walk the walk to healing planet earth and its citizens.

       I want to be like Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk because I admire their being and the inspire me to be innovative and tackle problems in the world.
        I also have found a passion for Djing and I desire to be the best DJ in the world and touching the world through my skills.
